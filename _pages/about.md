This is Shaobo Zhang, a serious biological researcher interested in various fields of the amazing life science. Trained as a computational biologist, I am combining state-of-art imaging techniques, genetics, genomic analysis, and quantitative data mining to decipher the hidden secretes of life.  

Education
======
1. 2010-2014: Shanghai Jiao Tong Unviersity; Bachelor Degreen in Bioinformatics; Graduated with Honors Thesis (Top 1%)
1. 2014-2019: Mechanobiology Insitute, National University of Singpaore; Ph.D. Degree in Mehcanobiology (Integrative Sciences and Engineering)

Research Experience
======
1. 2014-2020: PhD Student & Research Assisocciate at Mechanobiology Institute, Singapore 

    • Independently developed a simplified in vivo system to study cell matching/cell targeting and identified the major molecular regulators and the underlying mechanisms of cell matching process, which led to two first author publications

    •	Built Multiview Light-sheet Microscope (contributed to the hardware control and software development) and developed image analysis tools to perform quantitative analysis, which lead to three co-author publications

1. 2018-2018: Visiting Researcher in IRI for the Life Sciences at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Germany

    •	Applied computational analysis of single cell ATAC sequencing data, isolated heart cell specific cluster, revealed the potential tissue-specific transcription regulatory regions, and performed experimental test of the sequencing data-driven predictions

1. 2012-2014: Undergraduate Researchers at Department of Bioinformatics & Biostatistics, Institute of Bioinformatics at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China

    •	Applied computational system analysis to analyse sub-cellular metabolic network of Arabidopsis

    •	Utilized neural networks model to study the enzyme thermostability mechanisms of Thermophilic Xylanase
