This is Shaobo Zhang, a serious quantitative data-driven biological researcher interested in various fields of life science. Trained as a computational biologist, I am now combining state-of-art imaging techniques, molecular genetics, genomic analysis, and quantitative data mining to decipher the hidden secretes of life.  

Education
======
1. 2010-2014: Shanghai Jiao Tong Unviersity; Bachelor Degreen in Bioinformatics; Graduated with Honors Thesis (Top 1%)
1. 2014-2019: Mechanobiology Insitute, National University of Singpaore; Ph.D. Degree in Mehcanobiology (Integrative Sciences and Engineering)

Research Experience
======
1. 2014-2020: PhD Student & Research Assisocciate at Mechanobiology Institute, Singapore 

    • Independently developed a simplified in vivo system to study cell matching/cell targeting and identified the major molecular regulators & underlying mechanisms. This work leads to two Top-Tier first author publications.

    •	Built Multiview Light-sheet Microscope (contributied to the hardware control, software development, system upgrade & maintenance) and developed image analysis tools to perform automatic quantitative analysis. This work leads to three co-author publications.

1. 2018-2018: Visiting Researcher in IRI for the Life Sciences at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Germany

    •	Applied computational analysis of single cell ATAC sequencing data, isolated heart cell cluster, revealed the potential tissue-specific transcription lanscape, and performed experimental test of the sequencing data-driven predictions. This work leads to one first author publication.

1. 2012-2014: Undergraduate Researchers at Department of Bioinformatics & Biostatistics, Institute of Bioinformatics at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China

    •	Applied computational system analysis to analyse sub-cellular metabolic network of Arabidopsis; Utilized neural networks model to study the enzyme thermostability mechanisms of Thermophilic Xylanase.

Bio Art Works
======

I am fascinated about creating 3D illustration art works for better communciations in life science. Let's see some cool image of the Stem Cell (to see more interesting works, please check the '3D Bio-Blog' section):
