This is Shaobo Zhang, a serious biological researcher interested in various fields of the amazing life science. Trained as a computational biologist, I am combining state-of-art imaging techniques, genetics, genomic analysis, and quantitative data mining to decipher the hidden secretes of life.

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

Bio Art Works
======

I am fascinated about creating 3D illustration art works for better life sicnece communciations.

Let's see some cool image of the Stem Cell:
