Abstract:

Organ and tissue formation are complex three-dimensional processes involving cell division, growth, migration, and rearrangement, all of which occur within physically constrained regions. However, analyzing such processes in three dimensions in vivo is challenging. Here, we focus on the process of cellularization in the anterior pole of the early Drosophila embryo to explore how cells compete for space under geometric constraints. Using microfluidics combined with fluorescence microscopy, we extract quantitative information on the three-dimensional epithelial cell morphology. We observed a cellular membrane rearrangement in which cells exchange neighbors along the apical-basal axis. Such apical-to-basal neighbor exchanges were observed more frequently in the anterior pole than in the embryo trunk. Furthermore, cells within the anterior pole skewed toward the trunk along their long axis relative to the embryo surface, with maximum skew on the ventral side. We constructed a vertex model for cells in a curved environment. We could reproduce the observed cellular skew in both wild-type embryos and embryos with distorted morphology. Further, such modeling showed that cell rearrangements were more likely in ellipsoidal, compared with cylindrical, geometry. Overall, we demonstrate that geometric constraints can influence three-dimensional cell morphology and packing within epithelial tissues.
